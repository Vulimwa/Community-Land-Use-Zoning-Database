# Community Land Use & Zoning Database  

## Project Overview  
The **Community Land Use & Zoning Database** is a relational database system designed to support **urban and regional planning, land management, and policy monitoring**. It provides a structured way to manage **parcels, ownership records, zoning restrictions, land use changes, and development applications**.  

This project bridges the gap between **planning theory and practice**, enabling communities, planners, and decision-makers to **track developments, identify zoning violations, and analyze land use dynamics** in rapidly growing urban and peri-urban areas.

## Impact  
- **Transparency in Land Use** → Helps monitor how land is being utilized versus how it is zoned.  
- **Development Control** → Tracks applications, permits, and approvals for new projects.  
- **Conflict Resolution** → Records disputes related to parcels and their resolutions.  
- **Community Engagement** → Captures feedback from community members on land-related issues.  
- **Policy Monitoring** → Provides planners with insights into compliance with zoning laws and land use regulations.

## Key Features  
- **Parcel Management** → Records parcel size, location, ownership, and status.  
- **Zoning Control** → Stores zoning categories, restrictions, and permitted uses.  
- **Land Use Tracking** → Monitors how parcels are currently used and changes over time.  
- **Development Applications** → Manages proposed developments, approvals, and rejections.  
- **Permit Issuance** → Tracks issued permits and their conditions.  
- **Dispute Management** → Logs community disputes and their resolutions.  
- **Community Feedback** → Collects local voices on land use and zoning issues.

## Database Schema (Core Tables)  
1. **Owners** → landowners’ details (name, contact, ID number).  
2. **Parcels** → parcel details (location, size, ownership).  
3. **Zoning** → zoning classifications and restrictions.  
4. **LandUse** → current and historical land use per parcel.  
5. **DevelopmentApplications** → proposed developments and approval process.  
6. **Permits** → permits linked to applications with conditions.  
7. **LandUseChanges** → log of historical changes in land use.  
8. **Disputes** → community or ownership conflicts.  
9. **CommunityFeedback** → citizen engagement records.  
10. **Agencies** → planning/government bodies involved.

## Technology Used  
- **MySQL** → relational database management system.  
- **SQL** → for schema design, constraints, and queries.  
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model** → for database structure visualization.  

---

## Example Use Cases  
- **Identify zoning violations** → Find parcels whose current use does not align with their zoning category.  
- **Track development trends** → Analyze how land use has changed over time.  
- **Monitor pending applications** → Generate reports on proposed projects and their status.  
- **Engage communities** → Record and review community feedback on land and development issues.

## Career Relevance  
This project demonstrates skills in:  
- **Database Design & SQL** → creating normalized tables, constraints, and relationships.  
- **Urban Land Management** → applying database systems to real-world planning challenges.  
- **Policy & Governance** → monitoring compliance with zoning and development regulations.  
- **Community Engagement in Planning** → integrating citizen voices into land use data systems.
